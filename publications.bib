@article{Mohammad.2023_IJER,
 abstract = {The development of internal combustion engines is affected by the exhaust gas emissions legislation and the striving to increase performance. This demands for engine-out emission models that can be used for engine optimization for real driving emission controls. The prediction capability of physically and data-driven engine-out emission models is influenced by the system inputs, which are specified by the user and can lead to an improved accuracy with increasing number of inputs. Thereby the occurrence of irrelevant inputs becomes more probable, which have a low functional relation to the emissions and can lead to overfitting. Alternatively, data-driven methods can be used to detect irrelevant and redundant inputs. In this work, thermodynamic states are modeled based on 772 stationary measured test bench data from a commercial vehicle diesel engine. Afterward, 37 measured and modeled variables are led into a data-driven dimensionality reduction. For this purpose, approaches of supervised learning, such as lasso regression and linear support vector machine, and unsupervised learning methods like principal component analysis and factor analysis are applied to select and extract the relevant features. The selected and extracted features are used for regression by the support vector machine and the feedforward neural network to model the NOx, CO, HC, and soot emissions. This enables an evaluation of the modeling accuracy as a result of the dimensionality reduction. Using the methods in this work, the 37 variables are reduced to 25, 22, 11, and 16 inputs for NOx, CO, HC, and soot emission modeling while maintaining the accuracy. The features selected using the lasso algorithm provide more accurate learning of the regression models than the extracted features through principal component analysis and factor analysis. This results in test errors RMSETe for modeling NOx, CO, HC, and soot emissions 19.22 ppm, 6.46 ppm, 1.29 ppm, and 0.06 FSN, respectively.},

@inproceedings{Mohammad.2023_IsolLoc,
 abstract = {Parallel robots (PRs) allow for higher speeds in human-robot collaboration due to their lower moving masses but are more prone to unintended contact. For a safe reaction, knowledge of the location and force of a collision is useful. A novel algorithm for collision isolation and identification with proprioceptive information for a real PR is the scope of this work. To classify the collided body, the effects of contact forces at the links and platform of the PR are analyzed using a kinetostatic projection. This insight enables the derivation of features from the line of action of the estimated external force. The significance of these features is confirmed in experiments for various load cases. A feedforward neural network (FNN) classifies the collided body based on these physically modeled features. Generalization with the FNN to 300k load cases on the whole robot structure in other joint angle configurations is successfully performed with a collision-body classification accuracy of 84{\%} in the experiments. Platform collisions are isolated and identified with an explicit solution, while a particle filter estimates the location and force of a contact on a kinematic chain. Updating the particle filter with estimated external joint torques leads to an isolation error of less than 3 cm and an identification error of 4 N in a real-world experiment.},

@inproceedings{Mohammad.2023_Reaction,
 abstract = {Parallel robots (PRs) offer the potential for safe human-robot collaboration because of their low moving masses. Due to the in-parallel kinematic chains, the risk of contact in the form of collisions and clamping at a chain increases. Ensuring safety is investigated in this work through various contact reactions on a real planar PR. External forces are estimated based on proprioceptive information and a dynamics model, which allows contact detection. Retraction along the direction of the estimated line of action provides an instantaneous response to limit the occurring contact forces within the experiment to 70 N at a maximum velocity of 0.4 m/s. A reduction in the stiffness of a Cartesian impedance control is investigated as a further strategy. For clamping, a feedforward neural network (FNN) is trained and tested in different joint angle configurations to classify whether a collision or clamping occurs with an accuracy of 80{\%}. A second FNN classifies the clamping kinematic chain to enable a subsequent kinematic projection of the clamping joint angle onto the rotational platform coordinates. In this way, a structure opening is performed in addition to the softer retraction movement. The reaction strategies are compared in real-world experiments at different velocities and controller stiffnesses to demonstrate their effectiveness. The results show that in all collision and clamping experiments the PR terminates the contact in less than 130 ms.},

@inproceedings{Mohammad.2023_UncQuant,
 abstract = {In human-robot collaboration, unintentional physical contacts occur in the form of collisions and clamping, which must be detected and classified separately for a reaction. If certain collision or clamping situations are misclassified, reactions might occur that make the true contact case more dangerous. This work analyzes data-driven modeling based on physically modeled features like estimated external forces for clamping and collision classification with a real parallel robot. The prediction reliability of a feedforward neural network is investigated. Quantification of the classification uncertainty enables the distinction between safe versus unreliable classifications and optimal reactions like a retraction movement for collisions, structure opening for the clamping joint, and a fallback reaction in the form of a zero-g mode. This hypothesis is tested with experimental data of clamping and collision cases by analyzing dangerous misclassifications and then reducing them by the proposed uncertainty quantification. Finally, it is investigated how the approach of this work influences correctly classified clamping and collision scenarios.},

@misc{Mohammad.2025_SafePR,
 abstract = {Fast and safe motion is crucial for the successful deployment of physically interactive robots. Parallel robots (PRs) offer the potential for higher speeds while maintaining the same energy limits due to their low moving masses. However, they require methods for contact detection and reaction while avoiding singularities and self-collisions. We address this issue and present SafePR - a unified approach for the detection and localization, including the distinction between collision and clamping to perform a reaction that is safe for humans and feasible for PRs. Our approach uses information from the encoders and motor currents to estimate forces via a generalized-momentum observer. Neural networks and particle filters classify and localize the contacts. We introduce reactions with redundancy resolution to avoid type-II singularities and self-collisions. Our approach detected and terminated 72 real-world collision and clamping contacts with end-effector speeds of up to 1.5 m/s, each within 25-275 ms. The forces were below the thresholds from ISO/TS 15066. By using built-in sensors, SafePR enables safe interaction with already assembled PRs without the need for new hardware components.},
