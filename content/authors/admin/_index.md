#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a robotics and machine-learning engineer working at [Institute of Mechatronic Systems](https://www.imes.uni-hannover.de/en/), Leibniz University Hannover.

My fascination with modeling and controlling technical systems to create meaningful impact has driven me since my undergraduate studies - and continues to guide my professional journey. This motivation has deepened my curiosity and led me to develop [open-source](https://aranmoha.github.io/SafePR/) methods for perception and reactive safety strategies in robotic systems, focusing on real-time modeling and interaction control. The following video shows the motivation and achievements of my research:
