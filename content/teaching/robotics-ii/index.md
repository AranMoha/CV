The course [*Robotics II*](https://www.imes.uni-hannover.de/en/studies/master-lectures/robotics-ii) covers new trends in the field of robotics. Besides the calculation of the kinematics and dynamics of parallel robots, linear and nonlinear optimization techniques to identify key system parameters are presented. In addition, the lecture gives an overview on vision-based control methods as well as kinodynamic motion planning and robot learning.

The topics are
- Parallel robots
    - Different structures
    - Forward and inverse kinematics
    - Kinematic performance criteria
    - Dynamics
    - Redundant mechanisms
- Optimization and parameter identification
    - Linear and nonlinear algorithms
    - Deterministic optimization methods
    - Optimal excitation 
- Visual servoing
    - 2D and 3D approaches
    - Camera calibration
- Robotic motion learning 
    - Definitions and basic ideas
    - Motion planning
    - Iterative learning control
    - Hybrid reinforcement learning
