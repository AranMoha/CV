Grey-box modeling approach for predicting diesel engine emissions
<!--more-->
To address the challenge of tightening emission regulations and real driving emission (RDE) compliance, this work develops a hybrid grey-box modeling approach for predicting diesel engine emissions. By combining physically modeled combustion characteristics with data-driven machine learning models—specifically support vector machines and feedforward neural networks—the method leverages the robustness of physical models and the high accuracy of black-box approaches.
