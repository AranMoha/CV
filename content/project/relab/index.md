Remote Laboratory for Practical Education on Mechatronic Test Benches
<!--more-->
Remote laboratory (ReLab) is an open-source remote laboratory platform designed at the [Institute of Mechatronic Systems](https://www.imes.uni-hannover.de/en/), Leibniz University Hannover, to enhance robotics education by providing scalable, accessible, and hands-on experimentation outside the traditional classroom. Developed with off-the-shelf PCs, webcams, and a custom test bench, the system enables students to perform real experiments remotely. It is used in multiple robotics-related courses at Leibniz University Hannover to reinforce theoretical concepts through guided exercises.

Students interact with a Delta robot to explore kinematics, system identification, visual servoing, and machine learning via four structured tasks. The platform combines real-time experimentation, camera-based feedback, and gamified evaluation to support scalable and engaging robotics teaching.
