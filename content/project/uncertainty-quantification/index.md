Analysis of prediction reliability of a feedforward neural network for clamping and collision classification with a real parallel robot
<!--more-->
An approach to determine and distinguish dangerous false classifications and reactions (DFCRs) and less dangerous false classifications and reactions is presented using clamping and collision experiments of a real PR. A computationally efficient uncertainty measure from an FNN allows for reducing the number of DFCRs by performing a safe fallback reaction (SFR) in the form of a zero-g mode. The effects of the uncertainty measure and SFR on false and true classifications are described and validated using real measured data.
