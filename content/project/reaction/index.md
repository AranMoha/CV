Collision and clamping reactions for PRs in real-world experiments
<!--more-->
Clamping reactions using a structural opening are performed based on the clamping gap between two links of the previously classified affected leg chain.
Collisions are handled by retracting along the estimated force direction - independent of contact location - enabling immediate responses.
