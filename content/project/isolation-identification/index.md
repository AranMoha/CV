Algorithm for collision isolation and identification with proprioceptive information
<!--more-->
A feedforward neural network for binary clamp and collision classification was built with the estimation of the disturbance observer.
Physically modeled features describing the external forces are used to classify the collided body or the clamping leg chain.
