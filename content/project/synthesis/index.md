Robot synthesis by minimization of contact hazards based on analysis of collision and clamping
<!--more-->
Kinetostatic and kinematic objective functions are derived to describe clamping hazards in a human-robot collaboration with parallel robots. A kinetostatic projection of contact forces onto the drive torques is performed to evaluate the detectability of external contact forces in the motor current. The dimensional synthesis is performed by optimizing the objective functions for a reference trajectory and reference points. These objective functions of the resulting Pareto diagram represent clamping hazards in one (via the clamping angle) or between two kinematic chains (via the collision distance). The discussion of results by Pareto diagrams and radar charts gives directions for the detailed construction of the HRC-optimized PR.
