Supervised and unsupervised learning methods for feature selection and extraction
<!--more-->
This work addresses the challenge of modeling engine-out emissions for internal combustion engines under real driving conditions, balancing regulatory requirements and performance optimization. Using stationary test bench measurements from a commercial diesel engine, thermodynamic states were modeled and combined with measured and derived input variables. To reduce input dimensionality while preserving predictive accuracy, both supervised (Lasso regression, linear SVM) and unsupervised (PCA, factor analysis) learning methods were applied for feature selection and extraction.
